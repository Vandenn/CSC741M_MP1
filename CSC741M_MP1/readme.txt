HOW TO RUN THIS SOFTWARE:
Simply double-click on the CSC741M_MP1.exe to start the program.
Make sure you have a gold_standard.xml file in the same directory for evaluating results.
DO NOT touch the settings.xml file. You may edit the settings through the software's UI.

HOW TO USE THE SOFTWARE:
1. Load Query Image - Click the Browse Button beside the text box for the Query Image File Path. Choose the image (in .jpg/.jpeg) you want to use as query.
2. Choose Algorithm - Choose the algorithm to be used for the retrieval in the Algorithm drop-down box.
3. Click Run.

CONFIGURING THE SOFTWARE:
Click on Settings on the upper-left corner of the software's UI and click Configure.
Here you can edit several parameters. Hover over each of the settings to get a tooltip as to what it does.

ALGORITHM EVALUATION:
A special button on the lower hand side of the software's UI (Run Test Set) is used for testing an algorithm's performance. 
Use this functionality only if you have the WANG (1k images) database set as the Image Database Path in the Settings and if you have the appropriate gold_standard.xml file.
